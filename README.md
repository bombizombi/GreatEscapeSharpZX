# GreatEscapeZXSharp
ZX emulator for a single game.

The emulator works with a minimal set of instructions, just enough to run the game "Great Escape".
Most of the instructions don't update the required flags.  

Screen update is the slowest part and determinest the speed of the game, it needs to be changed to work with a local picture then send to windows form in one step.
